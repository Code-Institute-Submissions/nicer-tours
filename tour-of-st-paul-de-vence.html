                            <h2>Your Tour Of St. Paul de Vence:</h2>
                            <h3>Red carpets and a rural village</h3>
                            <p>The second most visited village in France for a reason: 
                            St.-Paul-de-Vence is home to artists, sculptors and bohemians of world renown. 
                            Founded in the 14th Century, the village has been both a regional capital and strategic outpost of 
                            offence and defence.</p>
                            <p>Today, the <em>cité</em> is famed for its connection with the artistic side of life. 
                            Home to Marc Chagall, its most famous resident died and is buried in the village. 
                            Be sure to lay a pebble on his grave, as is the Jewish tradition.</p>
                            <p>Before arriving in St.-Paul-de-Vence you’ll take a detour for a photo opportunity at the site of 
                            Cannes’ famous red carpet and film festival.</p>
                            <p>From Cannes, enjoy the scenery of the villas that line the coast of the <em>Côte d’Azur</em> as you’re 
                            driven towards the <em>cité</em> of St.-Paul-de-Vence.</p>
                            <p>Features of this tour:</p>
                            <h4>The Red Carpet in Cannes:</h4>
                            <p>Although we cannot guarantee the red carpet will be laid for your arrival - 
                            at times the red carpet is replaced with a blue, pink or yellow carpet, 
                            depending on the event being held at the <em>Palais des Festivals</em>, we can nonetheless guarantee you’ll feel 
                            like stars as your grab that all-important selfie on the stairs of the palace!</p>
                            <h4>A coastal drive:</h4>
                            <p>From the luxury boutiques of the <em>Boulevard de la Croisette</em> in Cannes to the rugged coastline and its elegant villas, 
                            you’ll enjoy stunning views from the comfort of your vehicle. Following the coast past Antibes, with its vast pleasure port, 
                            you’ll turn inland just before Nice as you head towards St.-Paul-de-Vence itself.</p>
                            <h4>St. Paul de Vence:</h4>
                            <p>Described by Vauban, military commander under Louis XIV, as being “unique in the world”, 
                            St.-Paul-de-Vence is reputed to enjoy a light more luminous than in any other part of Louis’ empire. 
                            As you stroll through the cobbled streets of the <em>cité</em>, be sure to take in this light. 
                            As you do, you’ll understand why so many artists have chosen to make the village their home. 
                            From Chagall to Renoir, Matisse to Picasso, Folon to Lévy, all have chosen either to visit or reside within its walls.</p>
                            <h4>The Ramparts:</h4>
                            <p>Be sure to take time to walk the length if the city walls - they’ll lead you to the cemetery in which Chagall is buried. 
                            Marvel how lucky you are to walk the walls, which were once sold off by the mayor of the <em>cité</em> without the knowledge of the residents! 
                            They still stand today as the locals were able to club together and buy them back before they were demolished...</p>
                            <h4>The Central Square and Folon Chapel:</h4>
                            <p>Otherwise known as the White Penitents Chapel, today it is most famous for its decorations by Jean-Michel Folon. 
                            The chapel decorations are as a testimony to the light of the village. 
                            The chapel is just behind the central church, which is also holds the remnants of one of the first popes, Pope Urbain. 
                            (Admission to the chapel not included in the price of this tour.)</p>
