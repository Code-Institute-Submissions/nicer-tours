GG for the constant presence and encouragement. You are a pearl!


## Credits (technologies, scripts)

Bootstrap for the Navbar, banner-image and modal code. 
I used a nested container set up - the image is the first, and contains two further containers: 
One on the left for the "company name" and one on the right for the navigation.

As bootstrap NavBars conform to a format, that of image / nav links grouped on a certain side of the screen, 
I decided that using this nested set up was better for what I was trying to achieve.

What I wanted was a rising NavBar with the company name staying static at the bottom of its container.
Thanks to [this Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5288336/put-text-at-bottom-of-div) 
I was able to achieve this effect.

Similarly, [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42586729/bootstrap-4-change-hamburger-toggler-color) 
suggested the use of a Font Awesome icon for the toggle, as Bootstrap's toggles conform to set colours, 
and try as I might, I could not change these presets.

## Credits (photos)

Unless otherwise stated, all images are my own. Some may appear on [this website](https://www.sunnydaysnice.com). 
The website owners are my former employers, and used my photos for their website.

## Future plans

Change the scroll direction of the banner image on the Home page so that the city of Nice and its beach is visible on smaller devices.
