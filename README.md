## Credits (general)

[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for the tuition.

[This little fellow](https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1008843/view/colorectal-cancer-cell-sem) for making me see sense.

GG for the constant presence and encouragement. You are a pearl!


## Credits (technologies, scripts)

Bootstrap for the Navbar, banner-image and the majority of the modal code. W3schools.com for instruction on form input types. 
The [Rosie Odenkirk resum√© project](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/ucd-resume/index.html) which I completed for Code Institue.

Note on NavBar: 

I used a nested container set up - the image is the first, and contains two further containers: 
One on the left for the "company name" and one on the right for the navigation.

As bootstrap NavBars conform to a format, that of image / nav links grouped on a certain side of the screen, 
I decided that using a nested set up was better for what I was trying to achieve.

What I wanted was a rising NavBar with the company name staying static at the bottom of its container.
Thanks to [this Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5288336/put-text-at-bottom-of-div) 
I was able to achieve this effect.

Similarly, [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42586729/bootstrap-4-change-hamburger-toggler-color) 
suggested the use of a Font Awesome icon for the toggle, as Bootstrap's toggles conform to set colours, 
and try as I might, I could not change these presets.

Further credits where due given within HTML pages.

## Credits (photos)

Unless otherwise stated, all images are my own. Some may appear on [this website](https://www.sunnydaysnice.com). 
The website owners are my former employers, and used my photos for their website.
You can confirm this by email: welcome@sunnydays.fr 

## Influences and choice of colours

This project is inspired by my former employment as a tour guide in the city of Nice, France.

The blue footer and button colours were chosen because this particular blue is emblematic of the city. 
It is the [Yves Klein International Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue) and was created by Klein, resident of Nice.
Although many believe that Klein copyrighted this colour, he in atual fact only registered it in a Soleau envelope, 
and thus has no exclusive rights over the use of this colour.

## Future plans

Get :pseudos to function as they should.

Create a dump page for the modals.

Add t&cs to scrolling popover using popper.js script instead of their own .html page.
